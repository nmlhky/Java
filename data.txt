Design and implement a RandomQueue.
This is an implementation of the Queue interface in which the remove()
operation removes an element that is chosen uniformly at random among
all the elements currently in the queue. (Think of a RandomQueue as a
 bag in which we can add elements or reach in and blindly remove some
 random element.) The add(x) and remove() operations in a RandomQueue
 should run in constant time per operation.
